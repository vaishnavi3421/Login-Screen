# Login-Screen Using Swift
  

This project is  built using **Swift & UIKit**. It includes basic validation for email and password fields, ensuring:  

 * The email field is not empty.  
 * The password field is not empty.  
 * The password length is at least **8 characters**.  

If validation fails, an **UIAlertController** displays relevant messages. Upon successful validation, a success alert is shown.  

### Features  
- **Text Fields**: Email & Password input fields  
- **Validation Alerts**: Ensures proper user input  
- **Simple UI**: Clean and easy-to-use login screen
